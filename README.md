# TKINTER_PROJECTS
PROJECTS ON PYTHON TKINTER

 IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE MADE A SIMPLE GUI DATA COLLECTION WINDOW
 WHERE THE COMPUTER COLLECTS THE BASIC DATA LIKE NAME,PHONE NO, EMAIL ID, AND RESUME AND 
 SAVE IT IN A FOLDER.

 IN THE WINDOW YOU CAN FIND ALL THE USEFULL BUTTONS LIKE UPLOAD FILE(FOR RESUME), SAVE , LOOK FOR SAVED FILES, EXIT.
